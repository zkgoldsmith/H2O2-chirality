# Progress log for Katrina Mejia, CSI Princeton summer intern 2023

We will use this Github markdown as well as [this Doc]([url](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12itv_W-V2J_6J6nlkn0hcssBlbA7c94CLIHFn9NCGsg/edit?usp=sharing)) to set and meet our agenda for this project. Our objectives at this point are the following:

- Establish proficiecy with Linux command line and vi(m) text editor
- Gain experience using CP2K to perform DFT calculations of small molecules in vacuum
- Demonstrate the chirality of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> via its potential energy surface for its dihedral angle
- Use visualization software on both the cluster and your local machine to depict molecular structure, calculate distances and angles, plot isosurfaces of frontier orbitals
- Use software to make plots of relevant data

We will both update this space with instructions, snippets of code, input files, plots, results, etc. as we go to document our progress.

## DFT calculations of H<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
