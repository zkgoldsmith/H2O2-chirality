# Progress log for Katrina Mejia, CSI Princeton summer intern 2023

ZKG: We will use this Github markdown as well as [this Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12itv_W-V2J_6J6nlkn0hcssBlbA7c94CLIHFn9NCGsg/edit?usp=sharing) to set and meet our agenda for this project. Our objectives at this point are the following:

- Establish proficiecy with Linux command line and vi(m) text editor
- Gain experience using CP2K to perform DFT calculations of small molecules in vacuum
- Demonstrate the chirality of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> via its potential energy surface for its dihedral angle
- Use visualization software on both the cluster and your local machine to depict molecular structure, calculate distances and angles, plot isosurfaces of frontier orbitals
- Use software (not Excel) to make plots of relevant data

We will both update this space with instructions, snippets of code, input files, plots, results, etc. as we go to document our progress.

## ZKG: DFT calculations of H<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> molecules with CP2K

You can find CP2K input files for H<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on Della in subdirectories of `/home/zkg/Share/for-katrina`. Copy these files+directories to your `/scratch` directory with

```
cp -r /home/zkg/Share/for-katrina/H2* /path/to/your/scratch/
```

by filling in the path to your scratch. (Hint: if your present directory is your target directory then it is just `./`)

Once the files are in your scratch, start with the H<sub>2</sub>O single-point energy calculation, `cd H2O/energy`.

Review the CP2K input file `H2O.inp` by doing `vi H2O.inp`. If you built H2O in Avogadro and have the coordinates in an `*.xyz` file, delete the coordinates already there and replace them with those from your file. Otherwise you can use the coordinates already there. The coordinates are under the namelist `&COORD`.

Then, open the slurm submit script `job.sh`. Review the paramters at the top of the file such as the `job-name` and `time`. Then, in the `srun` command, change the path to reflect the CP2K `*.sif` file that you have installed in your Della `/scratch`. Once you have done that you can run the job from the command line:

```
sbatch job.sh
```

Now `cd ../../H2O2/energy` and do the same tasks: review the CP2K input and `job.sh` files, using your own H2O2 coordinates if you have them and making sure your own CP2K `*.sif` file is sourced in the submit script. Then, submit this job the same way.

If your job ran successfully, you can see the energy of the molecule with

```
grep "ENERGY|" [output file]
```

When the output file corresponds to a geometry optimization, you should get multiple calculated energies.

##KM: Results of DFT Calculations

After running the Single-Point Energy Calculation for H2O, the relevant data I collected was the end coordinates in the output file, the time spent runing the calculation, and the final energy values.

Time- H2O energy: 11.669 seconds


After plotting the total energy of the H2O molecule in google sheets using CP2K, the graph has an expoonential decay and remains stable at the eleventh step, reaching its lowest energy point at the last step, 41.



## ZKG: Linking and using pre-installed XCrysDen

I have copied over a pre-installed XCrysDen software package for you to do visualizations on the Della without any further installation. First add the following lines to your Della `~/.bashrc` file:

```
XCRYSDEN_TOPDIR=/home/zkg/Share/for-katrina/xcrysden-1.5.60-bin-semishared
XCRYSDEN_SCRATCH=/home/zkg/xcrysden_scratch
export XCRYSDEN_TOPDIR XCRYSDEN_SCRATCH
PATH="$XCRYSDEN_TOPDIR:$PATH:$XCRYSDEN_TOPDIR/scripts:$XCRYSDEN_TOPDIR/util"
```

Then do a `source ~/.bashrc`. Then, by simply using the command `xcrysden`, you should be able to open the program. You can read online about what file formats XCrysDen will support for you to quickly do visualizations and illustrate how e.g. the molecule went from it's inital to optimized geometry. You can `cd` to a directory where you performed a geometry optimization calculation and do the following:

```
xcrysden --xyz PROJECT-1-pos.xyz
```

And click through the prompts the GUI gives you as you deem appropriate.

## KM: Optimizations of H2O2
We previously optimized H2O and H2O2 using CP2K to recognize the lowest energy values of each molecules. With the values of the global minima for H2O2, I made graphs and charts to record the lowest energy values and the degree of each dihedral angle. The lowest energy value from the geometry optimization of H2O2 is -33.1266130021056. The XYZ coordinates before optimization for this energy value are the following:

```
O             0.00000        0.00000        0.00000
  
O             1.50000        0.00000        0.00000

H             0.00000        1.00000        0.00000

H             1.50000        0.00000        1.00000
```

With the lowest energy value discovered, I am able to transition to begin AIMD of H2O2 to recognize the change H2O2 will have, now that temperature is a factor of change in energy values. 

## ZKG: Initializing an AIMD trajectory of H<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> using CP2K

I prepared a CP2K input and slurm script for you to begin AIMD of H2O2. Copy them from my shared directory:

```
cp /home/zkg/Share/for-katrina/H2O2/md/* [new directory in your scratch for AIMD]
```

You will find a few new aspects in the input file, feel free to do a `diff` command between this `*.inp` and previous ones.

- The `&EXT_RESTART` section will be how you indicate whether you are restarting a run. After your initial job, this will be uncommented (automatically through the job script) to restart from where you left off.
- The `RUN_TYPE` now says `MD` because we are performing molecular dynamics
- The `WALLTIME` is now `02:00:00` (2 hours) because we are going to accumulate data rather than converge to a solution.
- There is now the namelist `&MD`. You can read about the meaning of these options here. The most important one for now is `TEMPERATURE`, which is in Kelvin. We are running at a high temperature to try to sample many configurations (and dihedral angles).
- Also note the `TIMESTEP`, which is the $\Delta t$ (in femtoseconds) used in our Verlet integration.

Edit the `&COORD` section with any choice of optimized coordinates from your own calculations.

Now see how the `job.sh` differs from previous calculations. You will of course need to edit the path to the executable with your own, as you have done previously. There is also an `if` loop after the `srun` line:

```
if [ -e PROJECT-1.restart ]
 then
  sed -i 's/#RESTART_FILE/RESTART_FILE/g' H2O2.inp
  sbatch job.sh
 else
  exit
fi
```

This means that if there exists a file `PROJECT-1.restart`, then do a sed command to uncomment the `RESTART_FILE` line in the input and re-submit the `job.sh` file. This will essentially continuously restart your calculation automatically, 24/7, until you want to stop it yourself.

Once youâ€™ve edited the input and job script as appropriate, go ahead and submit the calculation. We will discuss ways of checking and analyzing the output soon.
